				<h2>First Annual Neighborhood Holiday Light Contest </h2>
				<h3>12/7/2015</h3>

				<p>It's getting close to that time of the year and we're excited for the 1st Annual Holiday Light Contest on Prairie Fields! We're inviting anyone interested in participating to have their lights and decorations on display on December 13th from 5:30 to 7:00 PM.</p> 

				<p>Some of your neighbors will be hosting voting polls and offering treats and warm drinks <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prairiefieldshoa.com/uploads/2/2/9/1/22916178/pfhoa_voting_tables.png">(view the map by clicking here)</a>.  We will also be accepting donations for the Crisis Nursery at each of those locations.</p>

				<p>And what's a contest without some sort of prize to go with those bragging rights? There will be a trophy for the winner and one or two "major awards" for the runners up.</p>

					
					
			<h2>Snow removal</h2>
					<h3>11/17/2015</h3>
					
			<p>This year, the Prairie Fields HOA will begin paying for snow removal along Church Street and Prairie Rose south of the school (see map, below). This service will undoubtedly enhance the safety and accessibility for our residents and reduce the risk of liability from safety hazards as a result of winter weather.</p>

			  <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Board of Directors.</p>

				<p>Please remember that residents are responsible for cleaning snow and ice from the sidewalks adjacent (i.e., in front of, on the side of, in back of) to their properties.</p>
				
				
				
			<h2>November HOA board meeting</h2>
				<h3>11/16/2015</h3>
				
			<p>Tonight's HOA Board meeting has been moved to 502 E Tomaras. Everyone is welcome.</p>

			<h2>Now accepting Board of Directors applications</h2>
			<h3>10/3/2015</h3>
			
			<p>If you are interested in running for a seat on the PF HOA Board of Directors, you can download a application&nbsp;form&nbsp;<a href="/uploads/2/2/9/1/22916178/pf-hoa-2016-bod-application.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			
			<p>The day to day operations of the PF HOA are run by an all-volunteer Board of Directors, along with help from many other committee volunteers. The Board establishes the annual dues assessment and is responsible for using the money assessed to maintain and improve HOA property and offer programs which are of value to Prairie Fields residents, thereby increasing the value of the neighborhood. If you have 1-2 hours a month to donate to the neighborhood, you are encouraged to run one of the 3 upcoming vacancies on the Board for a term which begins January 1, 2016 and runs through December 31, 2018. Applications must be submitted by October 15.</p>
			<p>This year, voting will be conducted electronically. You can opt for paper ballots by dropping a note in the HOA dropbox. Homeowners must be a member in good standing to vote in the election, and not owe the association more than $10. You can access the<a href="/uploads/2/2/9/1/22916178/2014-10_past_due.xlsx">past due list by clicking here</a>.</p>

Most covenants address issues related to location on the property, materials used, colors (prairie earth tone colors), building permits, etc.  The ACC request form is available on the PFHOA  website.
