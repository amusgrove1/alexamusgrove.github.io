			<h1>FAQ</h1>
	   		<p>The day to day operations of the PF HOA are run by an all-volunteer Board of Directors, along with help from many other committee volunteers. The Board establishes the annual dues assessment and is responsible for using the money assessed to maintain and improve HOA property and offer programs which are of value to Prairie Fields residents, thereby increasing the value of the neighborhood. </p>

				<p>If you own property within the Prairie Fields subdivision, then you are a member of PF HOA.  When you purchased your property in Prairie Fields, you automatically became a member of the PF HOA.</p>

				<p><strong>What are the advantages of an active Homeowners Association?</strong><br>
				According to www.planersweb.com, an active HOA helps to ensure a neighborhood will remain physically attractive over many years, thus maintaining and often enhancing property values.</p>

				<p><strong>Are Homeowners Associations common in central Illinois?</strong><br>
				Nearly all newer neighborhoods in the Champaign-Urbana area have a Homeowners Association (HOA) to assist in maintaining the grounds around the neighborhood and to help maintain the quality of the development over many years.</p>

				<p><strong>What is the history of Prairie Fields Homeowners Association (PF HOA)? </strong><br>
				The PF HOA was incorporated in 1996 by the developer of Prairie Fields subdivision.  From 1996 to 2008, the developer performed and paid for all services of the HOA.  Starting in 2009, the developer transitioned the association to a resident run, resident funded HOA, and in the fall of 2009 the residents of Prairie Fields elected a Board of Directors (BOD).</p>
